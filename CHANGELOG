= Jzip CHANGELOG

== Version 1.0.0 (May 31, 2010)

* Refactored the entire code base (cleaned up the module and file structure and separated functionality)
* Improved Javascript file compiling
* Introduced Jzip partials
* Deprecated Jzip::Plugin (use Jzip::Engine instead)

== Version 0.2.1 (May 5, 2010)

* Altered the plugin initialization
* Refactored the code a bit (moved code to separate files and using Sass' method to trigger compiling)
* Added more logging info

== Version 0.2.0 (September 19, 2009)

* Refactored the requirements method:
  - enabled using a preleading '/' in the required_source parameter to specify 'RAILS_ROOT/public/javascripts'
  - using a more transparent approach of parsing 'defaults' to Prototype and Scriptaculous sources
  - being able to add predefined sources (such as 'defaults') with great ease
  - only adding a predefined source when the file exists
* Added a preleading '/' to the at installment generated Jzip template
* Not specifying the template location(s) in the Jzip::Plugin.options anymore (this let's you add template locations without having to know the whereabouts of other locations):
  - the locations are stored in a private variable
  - adding a template location has to be done by calling Jzip::Plugin.add_template_location

== Version 0.1.3 (September 1, 2009)

* Always parsing Jzip templates when on initial compile and options[:minify] is set to true

== Version 0.1.2 (August 31, 2009)

* Fixed bug in 'require_code' method (generating empty .js files)

== Version 0.1.1 (August 30, 2009)

* Only parsing Jzip templates when the target file doesn't exist or either the template or its required sources has been updated
* Provided the possibility of overruling the Jzip minification by adding an exclamation mark before the required source or defaults (e.g. //= require !foo)

== Version 0.1.0 (August 30, 2009)

* Initial release
